# Machine-Learning
This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. These algorithms cover a range of tasks including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch to help understand the underlying concepts and can serve as a learning resource for those interested in machine learning
